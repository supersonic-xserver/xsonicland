 * Create an EGLDisplay from a native display type. This is a little quirky
 * for a few reasons.
 *
 * 1: GetPlatformDisplayEXT and GetPlatformDisplay are the API you want to
 * use, but have different function signatures in the third argument; this
 * happens not to matter for us, at the moment, but it means epoxy won't alias
 * them together.
 *
 * 2: epoxy 1.3 and earlier don't understand EGL client extensions, which
 * means you can't call "eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT" directly, as the resolver
 * will crash.
 *
 * 3: You can't tell whether you have EGL 1.5 at this point, because
 * eglQueryString(EGL_VERSION) is a property of the display, which we don't
 * have yet. So you have to query for extensions no matter what. Fortunately
 * epoxy_has_egl_extension _does_ let you query for client extensions, so
 * we don't have to write our own extension string parsing.
 *
 * 4. There is no EGL_KHR_platform_base to complement the EXT one, thus one
 * needs to know EGL 1.5 is supported in order to use the eglGetPlatformDisplay
 * function pointer.
 * We can workaround this (circular dependency) by probing for the EGL 1.5
 * platform extensions (EGL_KHR_platform_gbm and friends) yet it doesn't seem
 * like mesa will be able to adverise these (even though it can do EGL 1.5).
